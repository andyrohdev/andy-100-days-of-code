### Day 1: September 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the 30 days of code challenge on HackerRank. I also did some bug fixing on my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad that I have started this challenge and hopefully will see great progress at the end of this.

### Day 2: September 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the 2nd Day in the HackerRank 30 days challenge, initiated my AWS certification process, and began working on the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to have established long-term goals that will guide my development journey over the next 100 days. I'm looking forward to achieving these milestones and growing as a developer.

### Day 3: September 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the HackerRank 30 Days challenge and completed 2/3 of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got sick, which slowed me down a bit, but I'm still making steady progress. I’m happy with how much I’ve accomplished despite the challenge of staying focused while resting.

### Day 4: September 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I explored web data scraping and started editing videos again for fun. I also took some time to relax and enjoy walks at the park.

**Thoughts**: It's important to balance work and life. While I’ve been focused on coding, it was great to take time to relax, be creative with video editing, and enjoy the outdoors.

### Day 5: September 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After a short break to recover from burnout, I got back into the challenge by applying to jobs, continuing with HackerRank challenges, and diving into Unity to create a test game.

**Thoughts**: Taking a break was necessary, but I'm excited to be back. Exploring Unity was particularly interesting because its interface feels similar to video editing software, which I'm familiar with. I can see myself experimenting more with Unity and perhaps even making a horror game in the future!
