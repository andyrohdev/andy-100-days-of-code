# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: September 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the 30 days of code challenge on HackerRank. I also did some bug fixing on my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad that I have started this challenge and hopefully will see great progress at the end of this.
