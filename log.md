### Day 1: September 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the 30 days of code challenge on HackerRank. I also did some bug fixing on my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad that I have started this challenge and hopefully will see great progress at the end of this.

### Day 2: September 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the 2nd Day in the HackerRank 30 days challenge, initiated my AWS certification process, and began working on the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to have established long-term goals that will guide my development journey over the next 100 days. I'm looking forward to achieving these milestones and growing as a developer.

### Day 3: September 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the HackerRank 30 Days challenge and completed 2/3 of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got sick, which slowed me down a bit, but I'm still making steady progress. I’m happy with how much I’ve accomplished despite the challenge of staying focused while resting.

### Day 4: September 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I explored web data scraping and started editing videos again for fun. I also took some time to relax and enjoy walks at the park.

**Thoughts**: It's important to balance work and life. While I’ve been focused on coding, it was great to take time to relax, be creative with video editing, and enjoy the outdoors.

### Day 5: September 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: After a short break to recover from burnout, I got back into the challenge by applying to jobs, continuing with HackerRank challenges, and diving into Unity to create a test game.

**Thoughts**: Taking a break was necessary, but I'm excited to be back. Exploring Unity was particularly interesting because its interface feels similar to video editing software, which I'm familiar with. I can see myself experimenting more with Unity and perhaps even making a horror game in the future!

### Day 6: October 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I finished an old front-end project that I started during Tech Elevator and fixed the issue where my resume wasn't being prompted properly when the button was pressed.

**Thoughts**: It feels great to revisit and wrap up projects that have been on my mind for a while. Fixing that resume button bug was satisfying, and I’m looking forward to pushing forward with more improvements!

### Day 7: October 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was challenging as I worked on getting the Web API up and running for my Spotify Profile Statistics Viewer. This is also my first time using **React**, so I’ve been getting familiar with the framework while troubleshooting the API issues. I wasn’t able to get it working just yet, but I’m learning a lot.

**Thoughts**: It’s frustrating, but I’m making progress, and I’m confident things will come together as I keep pushing forward.

### Day 8: October 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: After a lot of effort, I finally got the Web API working locally! However, hosting the project on GitHub Pages has been tricky, and as of now, the project is not fully functioning. I’ll need to explore other options for deployment, but I’m determined to get it working. 

**Thoughts**: This project is a big learning experience, especially with **React** being new to me. It’s not working fully yet, but I’m optimistic and will keep updating it as I make progress.

- ### Day 9: October 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a great day of progress for my Spotify Profile Overview application! I finally fixed a bug that caused the GitHub Pages error where users were being redirected twice. After spending a few hours troubleshooting, I managed to get the profile component working and added some CSS to polish the UI. I also resolved a 403 error related to how tokens were handled. To top it off, the app is now working on my friend’s machine!

**Thoughts**: I feel like React has been a game-changer. I’m learning so much about how to build better user interfaces and solve tricky problems. Next, I’ll be focusing on building the sidebar and expanding the feature set!
