### Day 3: September 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the HackerRank 30 Days challenge and completed 2/3 of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got sick, which slowed me down a bit, but I'm still making steady progress. I’m happy with how much I’ve accomplished despite the challenge of staying focused while resting.

### Day 4: September 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I explored web data scraping and started editing videos again for fun. I also took some time to relax and enjoy walks at the park.

**Thoughts**: It's important to balance work and life. While I’ve been focused on coding, it was great to take time to relax, be creative with video editing, and enjoy the outdoors.
